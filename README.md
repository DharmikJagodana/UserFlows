## Installation  
1. [Download](https://github.com/abynim/UserFlows.sketchplugin/archive/master.zip) and extract the contents of this repository.
2. Rename the extracted folder to `UserFlows.sketchplugin`.
3. Double-click the `UserFlows.sketchplugin` bundle to install it.

## Usage

#### Generate Flows
1. Select Layers that you want to use as hotspots (one Layer or Group per Artboard).
2. If you don't need hotspots, select the Artboard itself.
3. Run the plugin from `Plugins` > `User Flows` > `Generate a Flow`.

4. Enter details for the flow and hit `Generate`.

_Note: The sequence of screens in a flow is based on the `x` position of your Artboards. Sketch does not allow event-tracking (yet) so it's not possible to determine the order in which layers or Artboards were selected, although that would be ideal._

#### Settings
To manage settings for the plugin, go to `Plugins` > `User Flows` > `_Settings`.

Once you've installed the plugin you can trigger it using: `control` + `shift` + `f`.
