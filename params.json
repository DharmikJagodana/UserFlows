To check what version you have installed, go to `Sketch` > `About Sketch`.  \r\n![About Sketch](http://silverux.com/ig-auth/assets/sketchsquares-8a.png)\r\n\r\n## Installation  \r\n1. Download and extract the contents of this repository.\r\n2. Rename the extracted folder to `UserFlows.sketchplugin`.\r\n3. Double-click the `UserFlows.sketchplugin` bundle to install it.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n#### Generate Flows\r\n1. Select Layers that you want to use as hotspots (one Layer or Group per Artboard).\r\n2. If you don't need hotspots, select the Artboard itself.\r\n3. Run the plugin from `Plugins` > `User Flows` > `Generate a Flow`.\r\n![Generate Flow Dialog](http://silverux.com/sketchplugins/userflows/assets/generate_flow_dialog1.png)\r\n4. Enter details for the flow and hit `Generate`.\r\n\r\n_Note: The sequence of screens in a flow is based on the `x` position of your Artboards. Sketch does not allow event-tracking (yet) so it's not possible to determine the order in which layers or Artboards were selected, although that would be ideal._\r\n\r\n#### Settings\r\nTo manage settings for the plugin, go to `Plugins` > `User Flows` > `_Settings`.  \r\n![Settings Dialog](http://silverux.com/sketchplugins/userflows/assets/settings_dialog.png)\r\n\r\n## Shortcut\r\nOnce you've installed the plugin you can trigger it using: `control` + `shift` + `f`.\r\n\r\n## Bugs, Features and Feedback\r\nIf you encounter bugs, or think of some awesome enhancements, please create an Issue on Github or send a message on Twitter [@abynim](http://twitter.com/abynim).\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nMIT License Â© Aby Nimbalkar.
